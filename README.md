# 👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile.
## 🖥 Ryan Macedo

🎓 - I'm currently studying Software Engineering at **UMC - Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes**.  
Programming courses, hands-on projects and tech events sparked my passion for the field.

🎯 - At the moment, I'm focusing on learning *Python* because it was one of the first programming languages I came into contact with and it's a very versatile language, allowing you to build a variety of projects to improve your skills.

✏️ - In addition to programming, I also enjoy *drawing* and *playing games* as hobbies!

***I'm always interested in learning and discovering new features!*** 📚
